# Introduction to Algorithms Learning Journey

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive 48-week self-study program through "Introduction to Algorithms, 4th Edition" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (CLRS). The goal is to implement every algorithm from scratch in Python for deep understanding, rather than just reading theory.

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

**Core Principles:**
1. **No Rush**: 48 weeks for complete mastery
2. **From Scratch**: Implement everything personally, avoid copying
3. **Deep Understanding**: Focus on "why" not just "how"
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Every algorithm must be tested
5. **Performance Analysis**: Measure and analyze all implementations
