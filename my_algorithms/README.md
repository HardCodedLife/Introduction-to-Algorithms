## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Style
- Clear, readable Python code
- Comprehensive docstrings for all functions/classes
- Type hints where appropriate
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines

### Documentation
- Algorithm explanation in comments
- Time/space complexity analysis
- Examples and usage
- References to textbook sections

### Testing
- Unit tests for all implementations
- Edge case testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Correctness verification

### Progress Tracking
Each week folder will contain:
- `README.md` - Week goals and progress
- `algorithms.py` - Main implementations
- `tests.py` - Unit tests
- `analysis.py` - Performance analysis
- `notes.md` - Personal insights and learnings

## Getting Started
1. Start with Phase 1, Week 1
2. Read corresponding textbook chapters
3. Implement algorithms from scratch
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Document learnings and insights
6. Move to next week when complete

## Current Progress
- **Phase**: 1 (Mathematical Foundations)
- **Week**: 1 (Algorithm Analysis Fundamentals)
- **Status**: Setting up project structure
